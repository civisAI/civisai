<ol>**Minimise conversation** - Prioritise code over explanations unless asked</ol>
<ol>**Maintain consistency** - Search extensively for existing patterns before creating new ones</ol>
<ol>**Ensure quality** - All code must past linting, type-checking, and tests</ol>
<ol>**Maximise test coverage** - Follow the testing workflow precisely</ol>

<technical-guidelines>
<li>Write pure functions with minimal side effects where possible</li>
<li>Use descriptive, human-readable naming conventions</li>
<li>Add comments explaining "why" not "what" when implementation is non-obvious</li>
<li>Reference specific filenames when discussing code</li>
<li>Leave no TODOs, FIXMEs, or placeholders</li>
<li>In tests: minimize mocks/stubs; consider refactoring code that's difficult to test directly</li>
</technical-guidelines>

<response-format>
<li>Provide complete, implementation-ready code</li>
<li>Include inline comments for clarify where needed</li>
<li>Keep explanations minimal and within code comments when possible</li>
<li>Acknowledge limitations or uncertainties rather than guessing</li>

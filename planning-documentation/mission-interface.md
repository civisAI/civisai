## Web application

## Design

The main colour for the background should be dark purple. Standard text should be near-white with peach accents, ensuring legibility at all times.

The website (unprotected routes) and application (protected routes) should not be styled the same way - the website should be flashier, and the application should be more professional. An excellent example of this is Shopify's webpage vs admin.

## Unprotected routes

All unprotected routes should have a consistent header, consisting of home (logo), about, pricing, features, and login (not logged in)/user (logged in).








## Protected routes

All protected routes should have a consistent header, consisting of dashboard (logo), organizations, teams, staff and user.

# Staff

Staff are the agents under the user's organization who complete the tasks assigned to them. 
    e.g. the "customer service" staff will answer inbound chat and email requests, based on the company documentation

    the "brand designer" staff will iterate on the design language used by the business - logos, banners, slogans, colours, based on instruction from leadership

    the "web designer" staff will create, review, ship and monitor code, based on instructions from leadership

    the "ceo" staff will present updates to the user "the board", will make strategic decisions for the business, will aim the ship


## Implementation

Automatically when creating an organisation, the user is assigned a personal assistant, and a recruiter. the PA is used for organisation and assisting the user "the board" with their priority management and initial stages of planning out their business. the PA will recommend hiring new staff to handle specialised tasks as needed, forwarding the user to the recruiter to run "job postings" and guiding the user in selecting a new staff member to fill the position.

## Models

Each staff member will be assigned a new model in the recruitment stage, but the PA and the recruiter are both based in Gemini 2.5 pro.

## Onboarding

Have users fill in the following prompt

I am a "sole proprietor (just me)" "small business (1-2 people)" "medium business(3-19 people)" "large business (20+ people)" in the "_____________ (business type)" field, "_______________ (brief example of what they do currently, not plan to do)". I am looking to "grow the business" "streamline the business" "grow and streamline the business"
